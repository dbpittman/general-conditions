# Drawings

Examples, mockups, screenshots, sample outputs, and reference implementations.

## Purpose

Drawings show what the intended result looks like. They are the visual/concrete counterpart to the written Specifications.

## What Goes Here

- Screenshots or mockups of expected UI
- Sample API responses
- Reference implementations or code snippets
- Data format examples
- Architecture diagrams
- Workflow diagrams

## Naming Convention

`DWG-[spec_number]-[description].[ext]`

Example: `DWG-001-login_screen_mockup.png`, `DWG-002-api_response_example.json`

## Important

**The Specification always governs over Drawings when they conflict.** A Drawing shows intent. The Specification defines requirements. If a mockup shows a blue button but the Specification says green, the button is green.
