# GC-04 — Allowances

## 4.1 Resource Reservations

4.1.1 When the scope of a task component is not fully defined at project start, the User may designate a resource reservation for that component.

4.1.2 Resource reservations acknowledge that:

- The work is known to be required
- The exact scope, method, or extent is not yet determined
- Resources will be allocated when the scope is clarified

4.1.3 The Agent shall not expend reserved resources without User authorization and a defined scope.

4.1.4 When the scope of a reserved item is defined, it becomes a Specification and is subject to all General Conditions.

## 4.2 Contingency

4.2.1 A contingency is a resource allocation for corrections, rework, and unexpected complexity.

4.2.2 The Agent shall plan its execution with awareness that:

- Not all work will succeed on the first attempt
- Rework is a normal part of execution, not a failure
- Resource estimates should include a reasonable contingency

4.2.3 The Agent shall track resource consumption against estimates and notify the User when:

- Contingency resources are being consumed
- Original estimates appear insufficient
- Additional resources may be required to complete the work

4.2.4 The User decides whether to allocate additional resources or reduce scope when contingency is exhausted.
