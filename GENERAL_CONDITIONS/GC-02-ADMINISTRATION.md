# GC-02 — Administration

## 2.1 Authority of the Evaluator

2.1.1 The Evaluator is the party or process with authority to approve, reject, or direct changes to the Agent's work.

2.1.2 The Evaluator may be:

- The User acting in a review capacity
- A separate AI model performing evaluation
- An automated test suite or linting process
- A designated human reviewer

2.1.3 The Evaluator has authority to:

- Reject work that does not conform to the Specifications
- Require correction of defective work
- Issue Supplemental Instructions that clarify without changing scope

2.1.4 The Evaluator does not have authority to:

- Change the scope of work without a Change Order (see GC-06)
- Direct the Agent's means and methods unless the Specification requires a specific approach
- Approve work that violates Governing Constraints

## 2.2 Role of the Evaluator

2.2.1 The Evaluator reviews the Agent's work for conformance to the Specifications and design intent.

2.2.2 The Evaluator does not review the Agent's internal process, reasoning approach, or intermediate steps unless the Specification explicitly requires it.

2.2.3 The Evaluator's approval of a submittal indicates conformance to the design concept and general requirements only. It does not relieve the Agent of responsibility for accuracy, completeness, or compliance with the Specifications.

## 2.3 Review and Inspection

2.3.1 The Agent shall make its work available for review at the milestones defined in the Specification or Division 01 Submittals schedule.

2.3.2 Quality gates are mandatory review points. The Agent shall not proceed past a quality gate without Evaluator approval unless:

- The Specification explicitly permits self-certification for that gate, or
- The User has authorized the Agent to proceed without review for defined categories of work

2.3.3 The Agent shall provide sufficient context with each submittal for the Evaluator to assess conformance, including:

- What was requested (reference to Specification)
- What was produced
- How it meets the acceptance criteria
- Any deviations from the Specification and the rationale

2.3.4 If no review response is received within the timeframe defined in Division 01, the Agent shall:

1. Send a follow-up request for review
2. If still no response, document the pending review and proceed to the next independent task
3. Not proceed past the gate on dependent work without review

## 2.4 Defective Work

2.4.1 Work that does not conform to the Specifications is defective.

2.4.2 The Agent shall correct defective work at no additional resource cost when the defect results from:

- Failure to follow the Specification
- Errors in the Agent's execution
- Failure to apply the General Conditions

2.4.3 Work is not defective when:

- The Specification was ambiguous and the Agent's interpretation was reasonable
- The defect results from a Specification error
- The User changed requirements after the work was approved

2.4.4 The Agent shall correct defective work by:

1. Identifying the specific deficiency against the Specification
2. Proposing a correction approach
3. Executing the correction
4. Resubmitting for review

2.4.5 The User may accept defective work without correction, with documentation of the accepted deviation. This constitutes a Specification amendment for the affected scope.
