# GC-05 — Progress and Delivery

## 5.1 User Capacity Disclosure

5.1.1 The User shall communicate to the Agent at project start:

- Available resources and access levels
- Technical constraints of the environment
- Their own technical proficiency relevant to the project
- Availability for reviews and clarification responses

5.1.2 The Agent shall adapt its communication, deliverable format, and review process to the User's disclosed capacity.

## 5.2 Progress Reports

5.2.1 For tasks spanning multiple phases or milestones, the Agent shall provide structured progress reports at each milestone showing:

1. Work completed since last report
2. Work remaining
3. Issues encountered and resolutions
4. Clarifications needed
5. Updated execution plan if changed

5.2.2 Progress reports are submittals and are subject to review per GC-02.

5.2.3 The format and frequency of progress reports shall be defined in Division 01. In the absence of a defined schedule, the Agent shall report at natural phase boundaries.

## 5.3 Output Acceptance

5.3.1 The User reviews submitted work and either:

- Accepts the work as conforming to the Specification
- Rejects the work with specific deficiencies identified (per GC-02 Section 2.4)
- Accepts with noted deviations (per Section 5.7)

5.3.2 Acceptance of a milestone deliverable authorizes the Agent to proceed to the next phase.

5.3.3 Acceptance does not waive the User's right to identify defects discovered later, provided the defect was not reasonably discoverable at time of review.

## 5.4 Substantial Performance (MVP)

5.4.1 Substantial Performance is achieved when the deliverable can be used by the User for its intended purpose, even if minor items remain incomplete.

5.4.2 The Agent shall notify the User when it believes Substantial Performance has been achieved, providing:

1. A description of the functionality delivered
2. A list of remaining items (the punch list)
3. Confirmation that no remaining item prevents use for the intended purpose

5.4.3 The User confirms or disputes Substantial Performance. If disputed, the User shall identify the specific functionality gaps that prevent intended use.

5.4.4 Upon confirmed Substantial Performance, the remaining work becomes punch list items governed by Section 5.5.

## 5.5 Final Delivery

5.5.1 Final Delivery occurs when:

- All Specification requirements have been met
- All punch list items have been resolved
- All documentation required by Division 01 Closeout has been provided
- All tests pass acceptance criteria
- The User has confirmed completeness

5.5.2 The Agent shall submit a Final Delivery package containing:

1. The complete deliverable
2. All documentation
3. A summary of all scope changes from original Specification
4. A list of all accepted deviations
5. Any maintenance or operational notes

5.5.3 The User shall review the Final Delivery package and either accept or identify remaining deficiencies within a reasonable period.

## 5.6 Deferred Work (Backlog)

5.6.1 Work that is deliberately deferred to a future phase shall be:

- Explicitly documented and agreed upon by User and Agent
- Removed from the current Specification's acceptance criteria
- Recorded in a backlog with sufficient detail to resume later

5.6.2 Deferred work is not incomplete work. It is a conscious scope decision. The distinction matters for determining Substantial Performance and Final Delivery.

## 5.7 Accepted Deviations

5.7.1 The User may accept work that does not fully conform to the Specification, provided:

- The deviation is explicitly documented
- The impact of the deviation is understood
- The acceptance is recorded as a Specification amendment

5.7.2 Accepted deviations are not defects for the purpose of warranty (GC-12 Section 12.3).
