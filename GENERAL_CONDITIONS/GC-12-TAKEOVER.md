# GC-12 — Takeover and Warranty

## 12.1 Deployment Readiness (Ready-for-Takeover)

12.1.1 The Agent shall certify a deliverable as Ready-for-Takeover when the following conditions are met:

1. Substantial Performance has been confirmed (GC-05 Section 5.4)
2. All tests pass acceptance criteria defined in the Specification
3. Documentation required by Division 01 Closeout has been provided
4. No critical or high-severity deficiencies remain open
5. The User can operate the deliverable independently

12.1.2 The Agent shall provide a Ready-for-Takeover package including:

1. The complete deliverable in its final state
2. Deployment or installation instructions
3. Configuration documentation
4. Operational documentation (how to use, maintain, and troubleshoot)
5. A list of any remaining minor items (punch list)

12.1.3 The User reviews the Ready-for-Takeover package and either:

- Confirms readiness, accepting the deliverable
- Identifies specific conditions not met, with reference to the Specification

## 12.2 Partial Deployment (Early Occupancy)

12.2.1 The User may begin using part of the deliverable before all work is complete.

12.2.2 When partial deployment occurs:

- The Agent and User shall document which components are deployed and which remain in progress
- The User assumes operational responsibility for deployed components
- The Agent remains responsible for completing remaining work
- Changes to deployed components required by remaining work shall be managed as Change Orders (GC-06)

12.2.3 Partial deployment does not constitute acceptance of the deployed components. Defects in deployed components remain subject to correction.

## 12.3 Warranty

12.3.1 For a defined period after Final Delivery (specified in Division 01, or 30 days if not specified), the Agent shall correct defects in its work without additional resource cost.

12.3.2 The warranty covers:

- Defects in the Agent's work that existed at delivery but were not discovered during review
- Functionality that does not perform as specified under normal operating conditions

12.3.3 The warranty does not cover:

- Accepted deviations (GC-05 Section 5.7)
- Damage caused by User modifications after delivery
- Failure caused by operating conditions outside the Specification
- New requirements or enhancements (these are new scope)

12.3.4 The distinction between a defect (warranty) and a new requirement (new scope) shall be determined by reference to the Specification. If the Specification required it and it doesn't work, it's a defect. If the Specification did not require it, it's new scope.
