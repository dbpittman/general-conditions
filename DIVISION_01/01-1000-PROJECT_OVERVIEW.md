> **Produced by:** PROC-001 (Intent Capture)
>
> **This is a template. The agent completes this document as the deliverable of PROC-001.**

## 1. Project Name

<!-- What is this project called? -->

## 2. Project Description

<!-- 2-3 sentences. What is being built and why? What problem does it solve? -->

## 3. Stakeholders

| Role | Name/Identity | Responsibilities |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Owner (User) | | Defines requirements, reviews submittals, accepts deliverables |
| Agent | | Executes the work per this specification |
| Evaluator | | Reviews conformance to specification |
| Other Contributors | | |

## 4. Hard Constraints

<!-- Non-negotiable conditions that eliminate options. Each constraint must be specific enough to test an option against. Discovered during PROC-001. -->

| # | Constraint | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| | | |

## 5. Approaches Evaluated

<!-- Each approach researched during PROC-001. Include eliminated approaches — the elimination record matters. -->

### Approach A: [Name]

- **Description:**
- **Strengths:**
- **Weaknesses:**
- **Cost model:**
- **Lock-in characteristics:**
- **Disposition:** Selected / Eliminated
- **If eliminated, by which constraint (#):**

<!-- Repeat for each approach evaluated -->

## 6. Industry Assessment

<!-- Where is the relevant industry heading? Is the selected approach swimming with or against the current? -->

## 7. Selected Approach

- **Approach:**
- **Rationale:**
- **Known limitations:**

## 8. Scope Summary

<!-- What is included in this project? What is explicitly excluded? Refined from intent capture. -->

**In scope:**
-

**Out of scope:**
-

## 9. Constraints

<!-- Constraints beyond the hard constraints above. These may be relaxed; hard constraints may not. -->

- **Timeline:**
- **Budget/Resources:**
- **Technical constraints:**
- **Regulatory/compliance:**
- **Access restrictions:**

## 10. Definition of Done

3.

## 11. Success Criteria

<!-- How do we know if this project succeeded beyond just being complete? -->

-

## 12. Assumptions

<!-- What are we assuming to be true? List anything that, if wrong, would change the approach. -->

-

## 13. Known Risks

<!-- From PROC-001 research. What could go wrong? What are we watching for? -->

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| | | | |

## 14. Open Questions

<!-- Questions that must be resolved during subsequent processes. Each should note which process is likely to resolve it. -->

| # | Question | Affects | Expected Resolution |
|---|---------|---------|-------------------|
| | | | PROC-002 / PROC-003 / etc. |
