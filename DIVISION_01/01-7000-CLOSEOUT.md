# 01-7000 — Closeout Requirements

> **Produced by:** PROC-011 (Task Delivery) begins this document. PROC-012 (Documentation and Handoff) completes it.
>
> **This is a template. The agent completes the requirements section during PROC-002 (defining what closeout will require), fills in the delivery sections during PROC-011/012.**
>
> Implements GC-12 (Takeover).

5. User reviews against this closeout checklist
6. User identifies any remaining deficiencies
7. Agent corrects deficiencies
8. User confirms Final Acceptance

## Post-Delivery
