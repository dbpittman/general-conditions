# 01-6000 — Materials and Methods

> **Produced by:** PROC-002 (Approach Proposal) for technology stack selection, completed by PROC-004 (Execution Instructions) for development practices
>
> **This is a template. The agent completes the technology stack during PROC-002 (when the approach determines the tools) and the development practices during PROC-004 (when implementation planning determines the workflow).**
>
> Implements GC-03 Section 3.7 (code quality and dependencies).
